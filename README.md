## 📝 Final Project: Rainfall Prediction Classifier
This is the final project from the Coursera course **"Machine Learning with Python**" by IBM.

## 🔍 Project Summary
The goal was to build a classification model to predict whether it would rain the next day in Australia.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
Explored and performed feature engineering on a real-world dataset
Built a classifier pipeline using Pipeline from scikit-learn
Optimized hyperparameters using Grid Search with cross-validation
Evaluated the classifier using performance metrics and visualizations
Replaced the classifier in the pipeline and re-evaluated
Tested the classifier with an appropriate parameter set for each case
