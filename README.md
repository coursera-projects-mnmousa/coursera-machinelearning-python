## 📝 Final Project: Rainfall Prediction Classifier
This is the final project from the Coursera course **"Machine Learning with Python**" by IBM.

## 🔍 Project Summary
The goal was to build a classification model to predict whether it would rain the next day in Australia.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
1. Mapped dates to seasons and dropped the Date column
2. Defined feature and target dataframes
3. Analyzed class balance
4. Listed insights from class distribution
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Automatically detected numerical and categorical columns
7. Combined transformers into a single preprocessing column transformer
8. Created a pipeline by combining preprocessing with a RandomForestClassifier
9. Instantiated and fit GridSearchCV to the pipeline
10. Displayed the model's estimated score
11. Got the model predictions from the grid search estimator on the unseen data
12. Printed the classification report
13. Plotted the confusion matrix
14. Extracted feature importances from the classifier
15. Updated the pipeline and parameter grid using a different classifier
